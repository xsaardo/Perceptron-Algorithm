# Perceptron-Algorithm
### Basic Nonoptimal Binary Classifier 

#### perceptron.m
Generates linearly separable dataset and applies perceptron algorithm to find separating hyperplane

#### perceptron3d.m
Also includes algorithm that works for 3D datasets that can be used for supervised RGB image segmentation
